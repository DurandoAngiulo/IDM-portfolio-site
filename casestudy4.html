        Assignment <b>Overview</b>
    </h2>
    <p class= "casestudytext">
        For my final project for Design for Media 1, I was tasked with creating a 
        moving black and white image. This could be done in any medium from 
        real-life film to immersive media. However, I chose to create a 2D animation 
        for my final project.

    <h2>
        Crafting my <b>Plot</b>
    </h2>
    <p class= "casestudytext">
        Before I even started animating anything, I had to come up with a story that 
        would serve as the focus of my animation. This was tricky because I had to design 
        a plot that was short enough that  I would have enough time to animate, but also 
        long enough to be interesting and engaging to audiences. 
    </p>
    <p class= "secondparagraph">
        At the time of this project, I had recently finished playing a video game called 
        “The Ghost of Tsushima”. Within the game, there were moments 
        called “Standoffs” where the player would face down an opponent and finish 
        them in one blow. I decided to design my story around this idea.

    <h2>
         Making <b>Concept</b> Art
    </h2>
    <p class= "casestudytext">
        Next I began creating concept art for my characters in their respective scenes 
        and gathering reference material for posing. This was important to do because 
        I needed sketches/images to fall back on when I actually began to animate. 
        Having that visual content to reference and use as templates proved to be 
        extremely helpful during the course of the project.

         Blocking my <b>Movements</b> 
    </h2>
    <p class= "casestudytext">
        Now that I had everything prepped, I actually had to… animate my story. 
        Prior to this assignment. I had zero prior experience doing animation of any kind.
    </p> 
    <p class= "secondparagraph">
        So I did what anyone who needed to learn how to do something new did: 
        go to YouTube. I eventually settled on using Adobe Animate to do my animation
        because it wasn’t an extreme learning curve and it had plenty of tutorials from 
        both Adobe and community creators to learn how to use it.
    </p>   
    <p class= "secondparagraph">
        As I worked through animating my scenes, I purely focused on animating the motions
        that would be taking place in each scene. I did things this way so I could get a 
        rough version of all my animations done and so I could focus purely on refining 
        things and adding detail the next time around.

    <h2>
         Adding <b>Refinements</b> and <b>Detail</b>
    </h2>
    <p class= "casestudytext">
        Next, I went back through all my completed scenes and tweaked motions and tried 
        to heighten visual designs of characters and their scenes. I also used this step 
        to add smaller detailed animations into all my scenes, giving the characters and 
        their environments more “life” and making them seem more interesting to look at.

        <b>Editing</b> my Content

    <p class= "casestudytext">
        After completely finishing my animation scenes, I then uploaded all my content 
        into Adobe Premier Pro for the editing process. It was here that I neatly strung 
        all my content together and added some visual effects to improve the overall 
        quality of my animation.

    <h2>
        Creating my <b>Score</b>
    </h2>
    <p class= "casestudytext">
        The last step I took towards completing my animation was adding a dynamic 
        score that complemented the story I was trying to tell. Prior to this assignment,
        I had no experience scoring any type of music apart from playing an instrument 
        in the past.
    </p>
    <p class= "secondparagraph">
        Because I was running close to my deadline at this point, I reached out to a 
        family friend with experience in the area for his help and advice. After telling
        him what I was looking for in my score, he in turned helped me craft a 
        dynamic composition that enhanced my animation that was adapted to my narrative.

        Final Thoughts

    <p class= "casestudytext">
        I honestly had a lot of fun working on this project. Of course never having 
        animated before, this assignment often proved difficult and frustrating. 
        However, it was a rewarding experience and I learned a lot about the world of 
        animation. I’m very happy with how my final cut turned out and I 
        look forward to experimenting around with animation again in the future!
