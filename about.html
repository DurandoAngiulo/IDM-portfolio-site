            <p>
                Hello! I'm Durando Angiulo, a student at Drexel University majoring in user Experience & Interaction Design.
                I’ve always been drawn to design and it’s my goal to become a great UX Designer one day.While I still have a 
                LOT to learn about my field, I couldn’t be more excited about my future in this dynamic industry! <br>
                For hobbies I love to ski and enjoy visiting and exploring new environments with my friends. I also like to 
                play video games, read books, and watch TV/Movies from the Science Fiction genre (I’m a big Star Wars nerd!).
