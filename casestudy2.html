            Rebranding <b>Nord VPN</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            For my final UX/UI project of my Freshman year, I was assigned with picking an
            existing app I knew well and mapping out it's interaction flow. Then, I was 
            tasked with completely rebranding my chosen app with a new name/logo and with
            a newly designed/animated interaction flow that highlights it's primary purpose.
            I chose Nord VPN for my app because I use it often as a user and know the ins 
            and outs of the interface very well.

            Mapping Nord's <b>Task Flow</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first thing I did beginning this process was mapping the current sequence 
            a user takes in order to complete Nord's primary task(In this case my task was
            to connect to a VPN Server). Taking this step helped me break down Nord’s UI 
            interface, making it easy for me to discern what I would keep and what I would 
            redesign for my rebranded version.

             Identifying <b>Interactions</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Next I sought out to break down my task flow into the core micro interactions 
            that occur when a user interacts with the interface through the completion of
            the primary task. This allowed me to gain further understanding about how the
             app actually flowed and provided me with inspiration on creating my own 
             microinteractions at future steps of the process.

             Picking a <b>Brand Name</b> 
        </h2>
        <p>
            The first thing I did before I began rebranding Nord VPN was picking a
            new name for my app. This was an important step because this name would 
            ultimately set the tone for my entire app and would have a significant 
            impact about the design choices I would make.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, I settled on CloudCover VPN for my rebranded app name. I choose 
            this name because it was a clever analogy for what a VPN does(Gives you 
            “cloudcover” from ISPs), and because I thought it would be fun to 
            incorporate a weather motif into my designs and microinteractions.

        <p>
            Next, using Nord’s current interface and my rebranded app name as inspiration,
            I sketched out some preliminary UI designs for my rebranded app. I used these 
            drawings as a launch pad to refine my designs in Figma towards my final UI 
            pages that would be involved in my taskflow animation

        <p>
            After finalizing my UI, I started designing the actual microinteractions that 
            would be present in my taskflow animation. While some micro interactions were 
            purely utilitarian, I really tried to embrace the motif/style of my rebranded 
            app to both give it more of a personality and make interacting with it memorable & unique

            After finalizing my designs in Figma, I then imported my layers over into 
            After Effects in order to build my animation. My first step was simply 
            blocking out my taskflow animation from start to finish. While this rough
            cut still needed to be tweaked and lacked proper timing, it gave me a solid 
            starting point for future refinement.

            Refining my <b>Timing</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            After blocking out my animation, my next and final step was to go back 
            through all my keyframes and adjust timing. Doing this made my animation 
            smoother and ensured that the speed of the animation was never too slow or 
            fast and that evrything looked more polished and real.

            Final Thoughts
        </h2>
        <p>
            This project was a lot of fun for me for two reasons. Firstly, this was my
            first assignment where I wasn’t redesigning an existing website/app and I 
            loved the freedom I was given to complete rebrand an app and make it my own.
        </p>   
        <p> Secondly, while using Adobe After Effects for the first time presented a lot 
            of challenges for me, I was super excited begin to learn my way through the
            software and use it to create something awesome.In the end, I am very proud of
            my final Taskflow animation. It looks and flows very naturally, all while 
            maintaining the artistic vision of what I set out to do with CloudCover VPN.
