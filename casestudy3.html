            <b>Redesigning</b> Techradar.com
        </h2>
        <p>
            For my 2nd official UI project, I was tasked with analyzing an existing news website and employ heuristic 
            analysis to identify its weaknesses. I then was charged with using the mobile-first design philosophy to 
            redesign the site at the three major breakpoints(Mobile, Tablet, & Desktop) with advertisement content 
            factored inFor this assignment, I chose Techradar.com because I felt that my personality made up a good 
            portion of the user base and that it would be easy to come up with an effective site redesign.

            Mapping the <b>Site</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            My first step in this process was to “map out” the current organization of Techradar.com. I accomplished this by:
            <ul>
                <li>Tracing over screenshots of of the actual site</li>
                <lil>Cataloging different image and written content as well as ads.</lil>
            </ul>
            The goal of this exercise was to gain insights and perspective on the site layout as it currently stands now.

             Identifying the <b>User</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
            From Techradar’s advertisement media kit, I was able to cultivate an idea of the site’s current audience 
            and constructed a preliminary user persona so I could get a better sense of who I was redesigning the site for. 
            Through my research, I determined that my average user was:
            <ul>
                <li>Young to Middle age</li>
                <li>College Educated</li>
                <li>Had higher incomes</li>
                <li>Technologically affluent</li>
                <li>Intelligent</li>

            Pinpointing <b>Weaknesses</b>

        <p>
            Next, I set out to identify the key problems within Techradar.com’s design. These factors 
            were based on a heuristic analysis I performed on the site, which fixated on identifying 
            usability issues that hampered the current site design. The main problems I identified as 
            a result of this assessment were that:
            <ul>
                <li>Ads were sometimes intrusive and were often put first over content, often taking away from the actual site</li>
                <li>The Navigational menu wasn’t intuitive which made navigating the actual site cumbersome</li>
                <li>The site lacked any Help and Feedback pages/forms</li>
                <li>The visual design was much to be desired and overall “uninspiring” or engaging to users.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            After finishing my initial breakdown of Techradar.com, I laid out my goals that I would focus on 
            in my redesign. My main focuses included:
            <ul>
                <li>Fixing navigation so that it is never hard or cumbersome to navigate the actual site.</li>
                <li>Changing advertisement placement/format so that ads are no longer intrusive or dominating over actual site content</li>
                <li>Overhauling the visual design to give the site a fresh look that engages audiences and reflects Techradar’s brand</li>

            My first step in designing my actual site again revolved around rough wireframe sketches. 
            These drawings weren’t about detail and their primary goal revolved around me getting my 
            initial layout ideas onto a physical space.

             Refining my <b>Vision</b>

        <p>
            From the previous sketches, I took the design I felt was the strongest of my ideations 
            and tried to refine it as best I could. the design I ended choosing was sharp and futuristic looking.
            While some of the content organization stayed the same, if shifted other elements around to fit the new 
            look I was going for. Within the visual design itself, there weren’t really soft angles and every piece 
            of image content had its own hard shadow behind it, whose goal as to make the image itself pop. While these 
            sketches were far from the completed redesign I wanted, they served as important groundwork for me to build 
            off of in the design process.

             Finding my <b>Colors</b>

        <p>
            Next, I consolidated a color palette that would be used in the creation of my redesign. I personally thought 
            Techradar’s current choice of colors were mostly bland and uninspiring.So, while selecting a new palette I 
            tried to shift the color scheme of the existing brand, while not abandoning the original colors completely. 
            For instance, while all the blues I used in my redesign were a shift from the original theme, I kept the 
            signature bold pink from the original colors and integrated it into my new color palette.

            After color selection, I then played around with different font and icon types. For this project, I again moved 
            away from Techradar.com’s current font and icon layout and instead tried to find alternative font types that fit
            the new design aesthetics I was going to implement in the redesign.

            Using the web prototyping software Figma, I begin building the elements that would make up my site redesign. 
            I did this using atomic design techniques starting with “atom” and “molecule” elements working my way up to 
            building “organisms” or groupings of atoms and molecules. This design workflow helped me keep all my site 
            elements organized and made it easy for me to make edits to the structure of of my site.

            After I completed all my style-based information and built the framework of my redesign, I created my High-Res
             wireframes in Figma, putting together all the work I had done in my earlier steps. These wireframes would ultimately 
             be used as the template to polish my final High-Res interactive Prototype and introduce interactivity.

            From my high-res wireframes, I populated my site redesign with actual Techradar.com content/advertisements 
            and added multiple types of interactivity to demo at all breakpoints, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Dropdown Menus/tabs</li>
                <li>Working Naviagation</li>

            Final thoughts
        </h2>
        <p>
            I was very happy how my final site redesign turned out. At the very least, I believe I addressed all the heuristic 
            problems present in Techradar.com’s current design. Using new skills I was introduced to during the design process 
            and by leaning on things I learned in my past projects, I felt that I made constructive and effective decisions that 
            gave my final redesign a fresh new perspective on what Techradar.com could potentially look like. Of course my redesign 
            itself isn’t perfect; I personally believe nothing you ever design can be truly perfect. But through this project I 
            can see that my skills and design instincts are growing. I still have a lot of learning to do to become better at UI
             Design, but its nice to see how i’ve improved during the course of this assignment.
