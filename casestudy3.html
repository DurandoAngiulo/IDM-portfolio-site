            The <b>Assignment</b>
        </h2>
        <p class= "casestudytext">
            For my 2nd official UI project, I was tasked with analyzing an existing 
            news website and employ heuristic analysis to identify its weaknesses. 
            I then was charged with using the mobile-first design philosophy to redesign 
            the site at the three major breakpoints(Mobile, Tablet, & Desktop) with 
            advertisement content factored in. I chose Techradar.com because I felt that 
            my personality made up a good portion of the user base and that it would 
            be easy to come up with an effective site redesign.

            Mapping the <b>Site</b>
        </h2>
        <p class= "casestudytext">
            My first step in this process was to “map out” the current organization of 
            Techradar.com. I accomplished this by:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracing over screenshots of of the actual site</li>
                <li>Cataloging different image and written content as well as ads.</li>
            </ul>
        <p class= "secondparagraph">    
            The goal of this exercise was to gain insights and perspective on the 
            site layout as it currently stands now.

             Identifying the <b>User</b>
        </h2>
        <p class= "casestudytext">
            From Techradar’s advertisement media kit, I was able to cultivate an idea 
            of the site’s current audience and constructed a preliminary user persona 
            so I could get a better sense of who I was redesigning the site for. Through 
            my research, I determined that my average user was:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Young to Middle age</li>
                <li>College Educated</li>
                <li>Had higher incomes</li>
                <li>Technologically affluent</li>
                <li>Intelligent</li>

        <p class= "casestudytext">
            Next, I set out to identify the key problems within Techradar.com’s design.
            These factors were based on a heuristic analysis I performed on the site,
            which fixated on identifying usability issues that hampered the current site 
            design. The main problems I identified as a result of this assessment were that:
        </p>   
            <ul>
                <li>Ads were sometimes intrusive and were often put first over content, 
                often taking away from the actual site</li>
                <li>The Navigational menu wasn’t intuitive which made navigating 
                the actual site cumbersome</li>
                <li>The site lacked any Help and Feedback pages/forms</li>
                <li>The visual design was much to be desired and overall 
                “uninspiring” or engaging to users.</li>

            After finishing my initial breakdown of Techradar.com, I laid out my goals

        </p>  
            <ul>
                <li>Fixing navigation so that it is never hard or cumbersome to navigate 
                the actual site.</li>
                <li>Changing advertisement placement/format so that ads are no longer 
                intrusive or dominating over actual site content</li>
                <li>Overhauling the visual design to give the site a fresh look that 
                xengages audiences and reflects Techradar’s brand</li>

            My first step in designing my actual site again revolved around rough 
            wireframe sketches. These drawings weren’t about detail and their primary
            goal revolved around me getting my initial layout ideas onto a physical space.

        <p class= "casestudytext">
            Next, I consolidated a color palette that would be used in the creation
            of my redesign. I personally thought Techradar’s current choice of colors 
            were mostly bland and uninspiring. So, while selecting a new palette I tried 
            to shift the color scheme of the existing brand, while not abandoning the 
            original colors completely. For instance, while all the blues I used in my 
            redesign were a shift from the original theme, I kept the signature bold pink 
            from the original colors and integrated it into my new color palette.

            After color selection, I then played around with different font and icon types. For this project, I again moved 
            away from Techradar.com’s current font and icon layout and instead tried to 
            find alternative font types that fit the new design aesthetics I was going 
            to implement in the redesign.

            Final Thoughts
        </h2>
        <p class= "casestudytext">
            I was very happy how my final site redesign turned out. At the very least, 
            I believe I addressed all the heuristic problems present in Techradar.com’s 
            current design. Using new skills I was introduced to during the design process 
            and by leaning on things I learned in my past projects, I felt that I made 
            constructive and effective decisions that gave my final redesign a fresh new 
            perspective on what Techradar.com could potentially look like. 
        </p>
        <p class= "secondparagraph">  
            Of course my redesign itself isn’t perfect; I personally believe nothing you 
            ever design can be truly perfect. I still have a lot of learning to do 
            to become better at UI Design, but its nice to see how i’ve improved over 
            the course of this assignment.
