           Designing for Digital Cultural Heritage

        <p class= "casestudytext">
        Over the summer of 2021, I participated in Drexel's STAR Scholars program. Over the course of this paid internship, 
        I served as the sole designer of the first iteration of a new Westphal College sub site who's goal was to highlight 
        student and faculty projects int he field of Digital Cultural Heritage.

            Consolidating Site <b>Assets</b>
        </h2>
        <p class= "casestudytext">
        Before I even began constructing the site, I first sorted through all 
        the visual and written assets that were to be included in the inital live iteration. 
        Doing this helped effectively envision and brainstorm potential site flows and hierarchy 
        based on what my faculty mentor/client wanted and what made the most sense based off my 
        experience and the site assets I was given.

             <b>Designing</b> the Site
        </h2>
        <p class= "casestudytext">
            WordPress was utilized to host and design this site so it could be integrated easily 
            with other university sub sites. When choosing my overarching site theme, I picked 
            a design that balanced strong navigational usability along with engaging colors and 
            visuals.
        </p>
        <p class= "secondparagraph">
            The purpose of the site was obviously first and foremost to house Drexel projects 
            and research in the field of Digital Cultural Heritage. But just as important, this 
            siteâ€™s goal was also to showcase this incredible work done by faculty and students alike. 
            I kept both these ideas in mind throughout my design and did my best to create a 
            site that efficiently catalogued these projects, but that was also fun and engaging 
            for users to explore.

             The <b>First</b> Live Iteration
        </h2>
        <p class= "casestudytext">
            By the end of my summer program I had successfully completed the first iteration 
            of the now live website. While the website is still not fully populated and is 
            missing some future key features, the groundwork has been laid and now serves as
            an important live demo of what the final product will be after its eventual completion.
        </p>
        <p class= "secondparagraph">
            I put in a lot of effort in many different areas to bring my vision for the website to life. 
            I also benefited a lot from this internship. From learning how to use WordPress from a 
            professional standpoint, to gaining valuable experience on interacting & working with 
            an actual client on a project (which prior to this point I had none). I have no regrets 
            spending my summer working on this project and look forward to putting the skills I gained towards my next endeavor.
