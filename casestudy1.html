            Creating a New <b>Website</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Over the summer of 2021, I participated in Drexel's STAR Scholars program. Over the course of this paid internship, 
        I served as the sole designer of the first iteration of a new Westphal College sub site who's goal was to highlight 
        student and faculty projects int he field of Digital Cultural Heritage.

            Consolidating Site <b>Assets</b>
        </h2>
        <p>
        Before I even began constructing the site, I first sorted through all the visual and written assets that were to be included 
        in the inital live iteration. Doing this helped effectively envision and brainstorm potential site flows and hierarchy based
        on what my faculty mentor/client wanted and what made the msot sense based off my experience and the site assets I was given.
        While no actual site consturction took place at this point, this step was critical to prepare for actually building the final
        site.

             <b>Designing</b> the Site
        </h2>
        <p>
            WordPress was utilized to host and design this site so it could be integrated easily with other university sub sites.
            When choosing my overarching site theme, I picked a design that balanced strong navigational usability along with engaging colors and visuals.
            The purpose of the site was obviously first and foremost to house Drexel projects and research in the field of Digital Cultural Heritage.
             But just as important, this site’s goal was also to showcase this incredible work done by faculty and students alike. I kept both these 
             important ideas in mind throughout my design and did my best to ultimately create a site that efficiently catalogued these projects, 
             but that was also fun and engaging for users to explore.

             The <b>First</b> Live Iteration
        </h2>
        <p>
            By the end of my summer program I had successfully completed the first iteration of the now live website. While the website is still 
            not fully populated and is missing some future key features, the groundwork has been laid and now serves as an important live demo of 
            what the final product will be after its eventual completion.
            My mentor and I were both very proud of what I was able to accomplish by myself over the course of the summer. I put in a lot of effort 
            in many different areas to fully realize my faculty mentor’s vision for the website.
            I benefited a lot from this internship. From learning how to use WordPress from a professional standpoint, to gaining valuable experience 
            on interacting & working with an actual client on a project (which prior to this point I had none). I have no regrets spending my summer 
            working on this project and look good to putting the skills I gained towards my next endeavor.
