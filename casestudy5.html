            <b>JA Electric</b> Site Design
        </h2>
        <p>
            This was a smaller freelance project I undertook. I was offered to design 
            a website for a local residential electrician Company called JA Electric.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company was based on a referral system and wanted a website so they 
            could expand their customer base.

            <b>Designing</b> the Site
        </h2>
        <p>
            I used SquareSpace to design and host this site. The software itself is 
            simple to understand and made it easy for me to build the elements I wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            When actually designing the site, I opted to go for a clean, modern, visual 
            aesthetic. I wanted a professional feel behind the site so I kept things 
            minimalist, but still tried to maintain engagement across the different pages.
            This made all my actual content pop and made it easy for potential customers 
            to navigate to what they were looking for.

            The <b>Final</b> Design
        </h2>
        <p>
            The client and I were both really happy with how the final site turned out! 
            The company now has a fully functioning site that promotes their business, 
            and makes it easy to get in contact with them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I definitely felt like I had succeeded in what I set out to do for this 
            project,and the practical experience was very helpful for me.
